# Unraid-templates
Templates for Unraid. [Reference to Squid's requirements](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/57181-docker-faq/#comment-566084)

This repository only contains .XML files in the subfolders. A seperate repository [unraid-template-misc](https://github.com/bgreen87/unraid-templates-misc/tree/main) contains icons for use by the containers.


## immich-public-proxy
This is an adaptation for an Unraid container to be added to the Community App store.
